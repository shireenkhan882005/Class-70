ONCE, on the bank of a river, a monkey made a home for
himself in a tree laden with fruit. He lived in it happily eating
to his heartâ€™s content the fruit of his choice.

The monkey was happy but lonely and wanted a
companion to talk to and share the fruits with. But there
was no one around, not even another monkey, till one day a
crocodile appeared on the riverside.
