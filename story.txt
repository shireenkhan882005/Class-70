ONCE, on the bank of a river, a monkey made a home for
himself in a tree laden with fruit. He lived in it happily eating
to his heart’s content the fruit of his choice.

The monkey was happy but lonely and wanted a
companion to talk to and share the fruits with. But there
was no one around, not even another monkey, till one day a
crocodile appeared on the riverside.

“Hello, there,” said the monkey. “Do you live in this river?
Would you like to eat some fruit?”
“Good morning,” replied the crocodile politely. “I did come
here in search of food for myself and my wife. Nice of you to
offer me fruit

The monkey plucked some from the nearest branch and
threw them down. The crocodile found them delicious.
“Thanks,” he said. “May I have some on my next visit?”
“Certainly, as many as you like and some for your wife
too,” said the monkey. “Do come again. I’m rather lonely here”

The crocodile visited the monkey regularly and ate the
fruits which his host threw down. He took some home for his
wife. The monkey and the crocodile were now the best of
friends. They talked and were never tired of talking. They
talked about birds and animals, about the villages nearby
and the difficulties villagers faced in raising good crops
for lack of rain.
